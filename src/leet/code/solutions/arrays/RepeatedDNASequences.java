https://leetcode.com/problems/repeated-dna-sequences/description/

The DNA sequence is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

For example, "ACGAATTCCG" is a DNA sequence.
When studying DNA, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string s that represents a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
Example 2:

Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is either 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.

    O(n) and O(n)

    Time Complexity: O(n)

            The function loops through the string once, from index 0 to (string length - 10)
            For a string of length n, we perform (n - 9) iterations
            Within each iteration:

            substring operation takes O(1) time in Java (though it creates a new String object)
            HashSet operations (contains and add) are O(1) on average
            Therefore, each iteration costs O(1)

            The final conversion from Set to ArrayList is O(k) where k is the number of unique repeated sequences (k â‰¤ n - 9)
            Overall: O(n - 9 + k) = O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)

            We store substrings in two HashSets:

            set: contains all seen 10-character sequences
            res: contains only the repeated sequences

            In the worst case, where most 10-character sequences repeat exactly once:

            set would store O(n) substrings
            res would store O(n) substrings

            Each substring requires O(1) space (since they're all fixed length of 10)
            The final ArrayList also requires O(k) space
            Overall: O(n)
