https://leetcode.com/problems/subarray-product-less-than-k/description/

Given an array of integers nums and an integer k, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than k.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,5,2,6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are:
[10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6]
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 0
Output: 0

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
0 <= k <= 106

    /**
     Key Insights for Learning

      Sliding Window Pattern: When you need to find contiguous subarrays with certain properties, consider sliding window

      Two Pointers: Use left and right pointers to maintain a valid window

      Counting Logic: right - left + 1 gives us all subarrays ending at the current position

      Edge Cases: Always check constraints (here: k â‰¤ 1 means no valid subarrays)

      This technique is commonly used in problems involving contiguous subarrays with product/sum constraints!
