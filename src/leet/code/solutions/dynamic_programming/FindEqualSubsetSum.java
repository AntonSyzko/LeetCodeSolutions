Equal Subset Sum Partition Problem
Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in both subsets is equal.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
Output: false
Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.


Problem Identification
Letâ€™s say that the array nums can be broken down into two subsets S1 and S2 of equal sums. We can observe the following things

// Sum of all the numbers in subset S1 + Sum of all the numbers in subset S2 = Sum of all the numbers in the array
Sum(S1) + Sum(S2) = Sum(nums)

// If Sum(S1) and Sum(S2) is equal
2*Sum(S1) = Sum(nums)

Sum(S1) = Sum(nums)/2

The problem reduces to finding a subset of sum Sum(nums)/2 in the array.
If we can find a subset of sum Sum(nums)/2 then we can definitely partition the array into two subsets of equal sums.
