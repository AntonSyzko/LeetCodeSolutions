Given a sorted array of non-negative distinct integers, find the smallest missing non-negative element in it.

For example,

Input:  nums[] = [0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15]
Output: The smallest missing element is 3

Input:  nums[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 11, 15]
Output: The smallest missing element is 0

 Input:  nums[] = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
 Output: The smallest missing element is 7

/**
    A simple analysis of the problem shows us that the smallest missing number would be the elementâ€™s index, which is not equal to its element.

    For instance, consider array [0, 1, 2, 6, 9, 11, 15].
    Here, the smallest missing element is 3 since 6 is present at index 3 (instead of element 3).
    If all elements in the array are at their right position,
    then the smallest missing number is equal to the array size;
     For instance, 6 in the case of [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
