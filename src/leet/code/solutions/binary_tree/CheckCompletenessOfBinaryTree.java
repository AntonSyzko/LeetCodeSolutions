Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.


Example 1:

Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: true
Explanation: Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.

Example 2:


Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]
Output: false
Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.


Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 100].
1 <= Node.val <= 1000
