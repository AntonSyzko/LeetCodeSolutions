Core Multithreading LeetCode Problems
Easy to Medium:

Print in Order (1114) - Use synchronization to ensure three threads print in sequence
Print FooBar Alternately (1115) - Two threads alternating between printing "foo" and "bar"
Print Zero Even Odd (1116) - Three threads coordinating to print numbers in a specific pattern
Building H2O (1117) - Synchronize hydrogen and oxygen threads to form water molecules

Medium to Hard:

The Dining Philosophers (1226) - Classic deadlock prevention problem
Fizz Buzz Multithreaded (1195) - Multiple threads implementing FizzBuzz with proper synchronization
Design Bounded Blocking Queue (1188) - Implement a thread-safe bounded queue
Traffic Light Controlled Intersection (1279) - Control car movements through an intersection

Key Concepts These Problems Test
Synchronization Mechanisms:

synchronized keyword and blocks
wait(), notify(), notifyAll()
CountDownLatch, CyclicBarrier
Semaphore for resource limiting
ReentrantLock and Condition variables
AtomicInteger and other atomic classes

Common Patterns:

Producer-consumer problems
Reader-writer scenarios
Thread coordination and ordering
Deadlock prevention
Resource sharing and mutual exclusion

Interview Preparation Tips
Start with the "Print in Order" problem as it introduces basic synchronization concepts, then progress through the others. Focus on understanding different synchronization approaches for each problem - many can be solved using multiple techniques (synchronized methods vs. locks vs. semaphores).
Practice explaining your reasoning for choosing specific synchronization primitives, as interviewers often ask about trade-offs between different approaches. Also be prepared to discuss potential issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and performance implications.
Would you like me to walk through the solution approach for any specific problem, or explain particular synchronization concepts in more detail?RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.Research Sonnet 4
